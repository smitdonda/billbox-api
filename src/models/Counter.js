 * One document per (user, model name), holding the last handed-out sequence

 * user: two accounts both start at Product #1.
 *
 * The unique compound index is what makes concurrent upserts safe — two
 * requests can never create a second counter for the same pair.
 *
 * Migrating from the old global counter: scripts/migrate-assign-owner.js
 * rebuilds these and drops the old unique index on `type` alone.
